# Applied Statistics

The Bayesian vs. Frequentist approach has been a long standing topic for debate. 
This repository consists of primarily Bayesian methods in applied statistics and often comparisons with the Frequentist counterpart of problem 
solving demonstrating how the former solution can be superior to the later approach when viewed under an appropriate lens.

The book [Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Bolstad](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118593165) is followed closesly and all the codes in this repository correspond to Computer Exercises from several Chapters.
