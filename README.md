# Applied Statistics

The Bayesian vs. Frequentist approach has been a long standing topic for debate. 
This repository consists of primarily Bayesian methods in applied statistics and often comparisons with the Frequentist counterpart of problem 
solving demonstrating how the former solution can be superior to the later approach when viewed under an appropriate lens.

The book [Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Bolstad](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118593165) is followed closesly and all the codes in this repository correspond to Computer Exercises from several Chapters. The main topics are summarized as below.

* Scientific Data Gathering, Displaying and Summarizing Data
* Discrete Random Variables, Bayesian Inference for Discrete Random  Variables
* Continuous Random Variables, Bayesian Inference for Binomial Proportion
* Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Inferences for Proportion
* Bayesian Inference for Poisson
* Bayesian Inference for Normal Mean
* Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Inferences for Mean
* Bayesian Inference for Difference Between Means
* Bayesian Inference for Simple Linear Regression

Following are some of the highlighting points for reference between Bayesian and Frequentist.

### Bayesian 
1) use of probabilities for both hypotheses and data.
2) depends on the prior and likelihood of observed data.
3) maybe computationally intensive due to integration over many parameters.

### Frequentist
1) never uses or gives the probability of a hypothesis.
2) depends on the likelihood for both observed and unobserved data.
3) does not require a prior.
4) tends to be less computationally intensive.
